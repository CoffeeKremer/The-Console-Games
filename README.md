# Console Game Overview
Console Game 1 and Console Game 2 is here in this repository.
Do not expect these games to be updated, as they were side projects from a while ago. 
These were from a time when I was new to python, so some of these are poorly coded.
Anyways, have fun!
## Console Game 1
Console Game 1 was a boredom project. It stemmed from very basic python knowledge. This was my first project.
### CG1 Overview
You have to make your way through a 20 floor tower, with each room haveing varing light levels. You can loot a room if you have enough fuel for your lantern. You may also come across an exchange machine on your way.
## Console Game 2
Console Game 2 was a final project for my CS class. This was for a grade, and I really pushed myself with this one.
### CG2 Overview
You are on an adventure. You must fight enemies and loot the regions, to eventully gain enough levels to fight the boss. There are 10 regions you can travel to, the one to the far west being the boss.
